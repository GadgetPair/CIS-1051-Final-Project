# CIS-1051-Final-Project
This project is a recreation of the classic game Space Invaders, with the twist that the enemies move straight down instead of the standard horizontal movement pattern. Huge thanks to the Space Invaders website for the sound files used for this game, in particular the player shooting sound effect as well as the player death explosion, both of which ended up being utilized in this project. I also want to shout out the user mrinalpande and their Space Invaders project, which provided a great starting point to work from, having built the player functionality as well as the creation and movement of enemies. Finally, the text is taken directly from the Harvard CS50x pong track, which guides through the creation of pong in lua.
My own work was the placement and count of the enemies that were on screen, as well as implementing both a victory and a defeat scenario, which were missing from the base that mrinalpande started. In addition, the coding for the interaction between the bullets and the enemies was slightly off, as the bullet would only despawn if it hit the first enemy that was created. The last thing worth noting was the fact that the code provided was slightly out of date, and required some modification to work with the modern version of lua.
